# Customer Personality Analysis

Welcome to the **Customer Personality Analysis** repository! This project aims to explore and analyze customer data, segmenting them based on various attributes to derive actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and clustering techniques, we identify distinct customer groups, leveraging Python and data science libraries for comprehensive analysis and visualization.

## Dataset Overview

The **Customer Personality Analysis** dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis), provides a comprehensive view of customer attributes, ideal for segmentation and analysis. Key features include:

- **ID**: Unique customer identifier
- **Year_Birth**: Customer's birth year
- **Education**: Education level
- **Marital_Status**: Marital status
- **Income**: Annual income
- **Kidhome**: Number of small children at home
- **Teenhome**: Number of teenagers at home
- **Dt_Customer**: Date of customer enrollment
- **Recency**: Number of days since the last purchase
- **Spending categories**: Amounts spent across various product categories
- **Response**: Customer response to the latest marketing campaign

Project Workflow
This project is structured into the following key steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing univariate and bivariate analyses, visualizing relationships, and gaining preliminary insights.
Feature Engineering: Preparing and engineering features for clustering analysis.
Customer Segmentation: Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify unique customer segments.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the clustering model's performance and interpreting segmentation outcomes.
Dashboard Development: Building an interactive dashboard to visualize segmentation and customer insights.
Usage
Exploratory Analysis: Open EDA.ipynb to analyze customer attributes and spending behavior, with visualizations of various customer trends.

Customer Segmentation: Use Model_Final.ipynb to execute clustering algorithms and identify distinct customer segments.

Dashboard: Run Dash.ipynb or customer_segmentation_app.py to visualize the segmentation and findings through an interactive dashboard.

Results
The analysis reveals valuable insights into customer segments based on demographics, purchasing behavior, and campaign responses. Key findings include:

Identification of high-value customer segments
Insights into purchasing behavior across different age groups and household compositions
Profiling of segments to guide targeted marketing efforts
